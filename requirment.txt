Full Stack Developer Project
Assessment
Objective
The goal of this assessment is to evaluate the candidate’s ability to design and implement a
Laravel application that meets real-world requirements. The submitted solution will be assessed
to determine whether it reflects the skills.
Problem Statement
We are launching a website uptime monitoring software where a client can provide an email
address and a list of websites they want monitored. The application must meet the following
requirements:
Functionality Requirements
1. Client Input:
○ Each client provides an email address.
○ Each client submits a list of websites they wish to monitor.
○ Client information will be manually entered into the database during
deployment.
2. Monitoring Process:
○ The homepages of the provided websites must be checked every 15 minutes.
○ If a website is unreachable within 10 seconds or returns an error, an alert must
be triggered.
3. Email Notification System:
○ An email should be sent to the client when a website is down.
○ The email subject line should be formatted as: "{website URL} is down!"
○ The email body should contain the same message.
○ The sender of the email should be do-not-reply@example.com.
4. Client and Website Display:
○ The home page will display a select input with the list of all client emails.
○ When a client email is selected in the select input, a bullet point list of all of the
client's websites will display as hyperlinks below the select input.
○ When a hyperlink is clicked, a dialog should appear with the text "You are about
to visit {website}. Do you want to continue?" with "Continue" and "Cancel"
options. If "Continue", the website opens in a new tab. If "Cancel", the dialog
simply closes.
Scalability Requirements
● The application should support hundreds of clients at launch.
● Each client should be able to monitor up to ten websites.
Technical Considerations
● This is a greenfield project intended to be continuously expanded with new features
and additional clients.
● The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) should focus on core functionality.
● The project will be deployed in a standard LAMP stack environment with Redis
installed.
● Laravel's built-in drivers will be used for all production configurations (e.g., SES for
email, etc.).
● The database should be MySQL or MariaDB.
● The frontend should be a Single Page Application built with Vue.js.
● There is no need to include any authentication because the website will not be publicly
accessible.
Submission Guidelines
● The estimated time for this project is 8-12 hours.
● Once completed, please upload the project to GitHub and share the repository link.
Evaluation Criteria
The project will be reviewed based on:
● Code quality and maintainability
● Adherence to Laravel best practices
● Efficiency of the website monitoring implementation
● Scalability considerations
● Error handling and robustness
● Proper use of Laravel’s built-in drivers
This assessment will help determine if the candidate has the required expertise to work on a
growing Laravel application effectively.
